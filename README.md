# BioTrack 360

Welcome to BioTrack 360, a project developed during the Hakerwrath Hackathon. Our project addresses the critical need for real-time health monitoring and emergency alert systems, particularly for elderly and vulnerable individuals. By leveraging IoT and AI technologies, BioTrack 360 provides continuous monitoring of vital signs and detects falls, ensuring timely intervention and peace of mind for users and their families.

## Features

- **Real-Time Patient Monitoring**: Continuously track patient vitals and display data on a dynamic dashboard.
- **AI-Based Rehab Routines**: Generate personalized rehabilitation routines powered by AI to aid faster recovery.
- **Fall Detection with Emergency Alerts**: Detect falls using gyroscope sensors and send emergency alerts via SMS.
- **Video Consultations**: Connect with healthcare professionals through seamless video consultations.
- **OCR-Powered Report Uploads**: Upload medical reports and extract important details using OCR technology.

## Hardware Components

- **ESP12E**: A Wi-Fi module used for connecting the device to the internet and transmitting data.
